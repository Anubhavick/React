we are using react library 
and it has react-dom and react-native

for web app react-dom and for app react-native but our base will all ways react 

// The way to create react (slower way)
--  npx create-react-app {here app name}
//other method is using vite
-- npm create vite@latest 
      then give project name and choose other thing cd to the project file and then npm install for node module 

      usually we .jsx extension for componnet and we can use js also with no problem but with vite we have to start with upper case and exten should be .jsx

 app.jsx is function that is running in the main.jsx     

 we can also return only one element so can put many element in <>inside this </>

DOM i have to learn to know more 

react is a single page web app so we have only one page and we update it that why only i compnet at a time but we can definelty add more by different ways function name should always start with the capital letter 
virutal dom 
hooks are imported from react when we needed them 

react fiber and dom in github library react arctitehure more reconlination 

tailwind css and props 
the concepts of props is to make componnet that are resuable 
 usuallly make component folder and add file we can use rfce mean just type this inside that folder we will get a snnipet  the file is .jsx

make a function 
we can wirte props like this insdie the function (props) or better way to chaneg the value or reuse the compent we do destructure it 
by this ({}) this methob we can write anythign in side and then put it insdie the component code {username} then this value will change when it will use like when we want we can also give defualt value ({username="hello"}) like this when we use prope we jsut need to this 

<h1 classnmae='card'> my name us {username }</h1>

and then we call this line jsut 
<card username="anubhav">
like this when we want to do and we can add more side by side
